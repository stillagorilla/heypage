# Components and Includes

Goal: normalize inconsistent mockup terms ("tile", "card", "voting stuff") into a single component taxonomy
so we can convert static HTML into reusable Django includes.

## Naming standards

Use: `component_*` names for conceptual UI blocks, and `partials/` for Django includes.

Examples:
- component_post → `templates/partials/post/post_card.html`
- component_comment → `templates/partials/post/comment.html`
- component_composer ("make post") → `templates/partials/post/composer.html`
- component_moderation ("voting stuff") → `templates/partials/moderation/mod_controls.html`

## Highest-value reusable blocks (initial list)

Global layout:
- `base.html` (page frame)
- `partials/nav/top_nav.html`
- `partials/nav/left_nav.html`
- `partials/footer.html` (if present)

Feed + posts:
- Post composer ("make post")
- Post card ("Post")
- Post kebab menu + actions (edit / propose deletion / delete)
- Comment list
- Comment composer (text + image + emoji)
- Media grid (post photos)
- Reaction picker / reaction summary

Moderation:
- "voting stuff" block (placeholder name in mockups)
  - Must match the custom democratic moderation model (not upvote/downvote/report).

Profile pages:
- Profile header (avatar, name, stats, buttons)
- Profile tabs nav
- “About”/details blocks
- Friends list grid
- Photo grid
- Groups list
- Reviews list

## Global layout includes (confirmed from mockups)

### Top navigation
Source mockup: `mockups-original/includes_topnav.html` :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

Django include:
- `templates/partials/nav/top_nav.html`

Contains:
- brand/logo → feed
- mobile side nav toggle (`#sideNavToggle`)
- friend request dropdown (accept/decline actions)
- chat link + badge
- notifications icon
- profile dropdown (view profile/settings/logout)
- live search UI:
  - input `#searchBox`
  - dropdown categorized Users / Groups / Businesses
  - “View All” button → hard results page (`search.html`)

### Side navigation
Source mockup: `mockups-original/includes_sidenav.html` :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

Django include:
- `templates/partials/nav/side_nav.html`

Contains:
- links to feed + owner-context pages (my-profile, my-friends, my-photos, my-reviews, my-groups, my-business)
- footer links and copyright

Implementation notes:
- Drive active state via context var `active_nav`.
- Use Django `url` names instead of hardcoded HTML filenames once routes exist.

## Profile header component (owner/public consolidated)

### Source mockups
- Public profile header: `mockups-original/includes_profile-head.html` :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- Owner profile header: `mockups-original/includes_my-profile-head.html` :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Django include
- `templates/partials/profile/profile_header.html`

### Context
- `profile_user`
- `is_owner` (bool)
- `active_tab` in {about, photos, friends, groups, reviews, business}
- `badges` (e.g., Representative, Influencer)
- `friendship_state` (none/requested/friends/blocked) [initial enum]
- `counts` (photos_count, friends_count, etc.) [optional]

### Owner-only UI
(from `includes_my-profile-head.html`) :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- “Change Photo” button
- pencil overlay on avatar
- “Edit Photo” modal with file upload UI

### Public/other-user UI
(from `includes_profile-head.html`) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- “Add to Friends” button (with toast success UI)
- kebab dropdown (Block User, Report User)

### Implementation rule
Do NOT keep separate templates for my-profile vs user-profile headers.
Use `is_owner` to toggle owner controls vs public controls.

## Implementation rule

Every time we find a repeated block in mockups:
1) Extract into `templates/partials/...`
2) Replace on templates via `{% include %}`
3) Record the include in this doc (so future refactors don’t re-split components).
